              <p>Dear member of the United States India Political Action committee,</p>
              <p>People from India have done well in America. We have two governors,
                Nikki Haley and Bobby Jindal, and many successful scientists and
                businessmen and people who have distinguished themselves in other important ways.</p>
                <p>Why are there no Indian American's in Congress, and how can we change this?
                   I think Statesmen PAC has an answer.</p>

                  <p>If we are to get Indian's elected to Congress we need a way for them to have
                    a voice and stature within a meaningful political community.</p>

                <!-- <h6>Introduction</h6> -->
                <p>We need political tools and talent to mentor new candidates and manage campaigns so they can win.</p>
                <p>
                  Statesmen PAC is a new interface between you and congressional candidates.
                  It's a place where you can get connected with a million people interested in better
                  government, experts in various fields, including you! This is where we will have
                  conversations about vital issues and find common ground. This is how we reach a
                  consensus and produce resolution on important issues.We have the way to deliver our
                  consent to our representatives, our congressmen.</p>
                  <p>This is your direct voice.</p>
                  <p>
                    <a href="https://statesmen.info/donate.html">I hope you will consider giving $199</a>, the maximum this "MicroPAC" will accept and
                    have other family members and friends do likewise. By contributing you join the PAC
                    and you can help identify Indian American and other statesmen around the country who
                    we all can support and help elect. StatesmenPAC will provide a network to clarify issues
                    and the tools to help statesmen-like candidates win. It is my goal to get 10 Indian
                    Americans elected to Congress. This is a big goal, but it can be accomplished by funding
                    StatesmenPAC, identifying statesmen among us and supporting them with our contributions and
                    helping them build grassroots organizations in their districts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Can you imagine the effect of 100 extraordinary men and women, people significantly beyond
                    the stature of our current congressmen, running together and being asked why they are so
                    different from common candidates? And can you imagine 10 Indian Americans among them? I can.
                    Please help me make this happen by supporting StatesmenPAC, a MicroPAC, with a <a href="https://statesmen.info/donate.html">$199 contribution</a>
                    from yourself, your family members and your friends.
